# HTTP Status Codes

## Objectives

1. Define status codes and what they communicate to a client
2. Describe the structure and various categories of status codes
3. Set a response's status code in Rack 


## Why Status Codes are Important for the Client

Status codes allow your server to tell something special to the client. The responses you send need to be effective to both a human user and to the browser itself. That means that  response messages like `File Not Found` or `Item isn't in the cart` work if there is a human to read the English. Browsers also want to know the status of the response. To get that response, the HTTP has an agreed upon contract for different "status codes". A status code is a 3-digit integer where the first digit represents the class of the response, and the remaining two digits represent a specific status. There are 5 primary values that the first digit can take.  

### Status Code Chart

Status Number | Code/Description
--------------|--------------------------
1             | 1xx: Informational (request received and continuing process)
2             | 2xx: Success (request successfully received, understood, and accepted)
3             | 3xx: Redirection (further action must be taken to complete request)
4             | 4xx: Client Error (request contains bad syntax and can't be completed)
5             | 5xx: Server Error (server couldn't complete request)

You've probably seen a bunch of these before, the most common being `404`. This means that the server couldn't find the route you requested.

### Status Codes in Rack

In Rack, we are able to set the response's status code by just setting the status_code attribute. By default, Rack sets a status code of `200`. But when a user selects a route that doesn't exist, we need to set the `status` to `404`. 

```ruby
class Application
  
  def call(env)
    resp = Rack::Response.new
    req = Rack::Request.new(env)

    if req.path=="/songs"
      resp.write "You requested the songs"
    else
      resp.write "Route not found"
      resp.status = 404
    end

    resp.finish
  end
end
```

Now if you go to `localhost:9292/badURL` you'll get the error message, and if you open up the Inspect Element navigator you'll see something like this:
